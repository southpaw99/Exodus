# GitHub Addon
***

The Git Browser for quickly installing Kodi repositories is now available as a standalone addon to install. This means that you no longer need the Indigo addon installed in order to use the functionality! Git Browser still exists inside of Indigo for those that want to take advantage of its other features as well. Git Browser simplifies the process of installing repositories and addons for new and inexperienced users greatly, allowing you to get the best Kodi addons quicker and easier.

GitHub is a data repository website that is home to most of today’s Kodi repositories. When you install a repository for Kodi, it is really just a shell that contains links to GitHub where other files and information are stored. Most developers use GitHub to store their files because change tracking is easy, there is unlimited bandwidth, and it is a free service to use. Multiple developers can update code on a single Kodi addon in GitHub.

By installing Kodi repositories and addons with the Git Browser, there are a number of advantages:

1. **Less sources in your file manager**: The Kodi community can be a confusing place for inexperienced users. Since addons tend to change source addresses so often, a lot of users have a massive amount of sources in their file manager. These can include old dead sources which do nothing but slow Kodi down. By using the method below, you no longer need to add sources to your file manager. Conversely, Kodi developers don’t need to find a .com source to host their repo any more.
2. **No need to remember repository.com sources**: Instead of remembering sources, which tend to change a lot, you now just need to know a developer’s GitHub username.
3. **Addon developers have more freedom**: Lots of addon developers choose to combine forces so that users only have to install one source in their file manager. This method allows developers to use GitHub (which most are using anyway) freely on their own. Installing repos by GitHub username will make it easier for developers to distribute their addons.
 

Users should also be aware that using Git Browser also has some disadvantages as well:

* You have to install Indigo, which has some usefulness in a variety of areas, but not all users may want the full addon.

* When you install Indigo, you will be bombarded with a popup each time you start Kodi. This popup is easy to dismiss, but it can be annoying seeing an advertisement for TVAddons every time. You CAN disable this popup in the Indigo addons by clicking the “opt out” option for popups.

* Not all Kodi repositories are stored on GitHub. We will do our best in our guides to list which ones are available and which aren’t.

* If you choose to install just the addon after searching with the GitHub Browser and not the full repository, the repo will not install and addons will not auto-update unless the addon has the repo listed as a dependency. This is an option that developers can choose to imlement. This is not the fault of Git Browser, but standard to all Kodi addons. Always make sure you are installing the repository only.
 

There is some misinformation about Indigo possibly performing malicious code, installing, or uninstalling other addons currently, which is simply not true.

 

**Git Browser TIPS:**

Please ensure that you have the latest version of Kodi when you are using the Git Browser.
Please make sure that you are installing the REPOSITORY only to ensure that you get all future updates. These filenames are always in the format **repository.NAME-x-x-x.zip**. Do not install the **plugin.video.NAME** zip files as this will not get you auto-updates in the future.
 

If you want to install Kodi addons and repositories quicker and easier, you must first have the Indigo Kodi plugin installed.
