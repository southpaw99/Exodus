# URL Resolver
***

URLResolver was originally created by TVAddons (source: http://fusion.tvaddons.co) and they store the official version. A few other repositories may also be hosting the addon update.

If you have either repo installed, your URLResolver should update to the latest copy automatically.

The URLResolver Kodi add-on works in the background of Kodi (called a dependency) to decode file hosts in order to play the root movie or TV video stream. If you are new to Kodi, you probably notice that a lot of add-ons use the same filehosts – Gvideo, clicknupload, zshare, dizilab are some of the popular ones. The URLResolver Kodi add-on knows how to navigate through these hosts, clicking through captcha’s and virtually retrieving the streaming file which you see in Kodi.

URLResolver is automatically installed with any add-on that uses it, so you probably have the latest Kodi URLResolver update on your box without event knowing it.
