## Kodil
***
The Kodil Repository hosts many all-time favorite addons. The anti-piracy shake-down broke many repositories and TV addons, but the **Kodil repository** remains strong. From the all-time favorite movie and television show TV addon [Exodus](https://github.com/PiSaucer/Exodus) to the best sports Kodi add-on SportsDevil, Kodil includes nearly everything people have bee clambering for in top-tier Kodi TV addons.

While the Kodi third-party scene has shown a massive amount of volatility over this past year, we present to you one of the most die-hard groups out there. The Kodil (KodIsrael) repository includes the most highly sought TV addons known, yet remains standing strong. Donâ€™t let that pacify you, however. Make sure you check the KFire TV home page often to keep on top of the comings and goings within the ever-changing Kodi third-party community.
