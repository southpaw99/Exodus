Exodus scrapes content (movies, music, videos) from around the web, and brings that for the user to view on their Kodi devices (TV, Boxes, Computers). After it scrapes for movie or TV show links It list the high quality ones at the top.

Exodus is one of the best Movie Addon and seems to be having some but not a lot of 4K streams as well.
Exodus is not legal by any means due to which it has been through controversy of been taken down by legal authorities such as MPA. This keeps happening with most of the popular third party addons. Don’t worry if the developer of an Addon gets down, someone else rises up and maintains the addon, since this is an Open Source Platform. (Me)

The Exodus Kodi addon grants you access to a varied library of online streaming sources, transfer you the most recent movies and television shows straight to Kodi. It’s one amongst the first reliable and complete Kodi video streaming add-ons far and away. It doesn’t compromise either speed or selection and offers an excellent choice of the first recent TV shows and flicks.
